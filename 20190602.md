# Data Structure Implementation

## Prerequisites
+ Maven
+ Git and Github
+ JUnit

## Fundamental data types
Value: collection of objects
Operations: insert, remove, iterate, test if empty
### Stack

LIFO.
+ push
+ pop

#### Linked list implementation
#### Array implementation

resize array
1. How to grow array?
Double size of array when it is full.
2. How to shrink array?
Halve size of array when it is one-quarter full.

#### Tradeoffs
##### Linked list implementation
+ Every operation takes constant time in the worst case.
+ Use extra time and space to deal with the links.

##### Array implementation
+ Every operation takes constant amortized time.
+ Less wasted space.

### Queue
FIFO.
+ enque
+ dequeue

#### Linked list implementation
#### Array implementation

## Generics

We implemented StackOfStrings. In addition, we also want StackOfURLs, StackOfInts, StackOfVans, ...

### Attempt 1. Implement a seperate stack class for each type.
+ Rewriting code is tedious and error-prone.
+ Maintaining cut0and pasted code is tedious and error-prone.

### Attempt 2. Implement a stack with items of type Object.
+ Casting is required in the client.
+ Casting is error-prone: run-time error if types mismatch.

### Attempt 3. Generics
+ Avoid casting in client.
+ Discover type mismatch error at compile-time instead of run-time.
