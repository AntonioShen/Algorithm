# Directed Graphs

## Definition
Set of vertices connected pairwise by directed edges.

## Digraph API

```
public class Digraph {
  Digraph(int V) //create an empty digraph with V vertices
  void addEdge(int v, int w) // add a directed edge v -> w

  Iterable<Integer> adg(int v) //vertices pointing from v
  int V() //number of vertices
  int E() //number of edges
}
```

## Adjacency-list digraph representation

```
public class Digraph {
  private final int V;
  private final Bag<Integer>[] adj;

  public Digraph(int V) {
    this.V = V;
    adj = (Bag<Integer>[]) new Bag[V];
    for(int v = 0; v < V; v++) {
      adj[v] = new Bag<Integer>();
    }
  }

  public void addEdge(int v, int w) {
    adj[v].add(w);
  }

  public Iterable<Integer> adj(int v) {
    return adj[v];
  }
}
```

## Digraph Search
Find all vertices reachable from s along a directed path.

### Depth-first search in digraphs
+ Every undirected graph is a digraph
+ DFS is a digraph algorithm

```
public class DirectedDFS {
  pricate boolean[] marked;

  public DirectedDFS(Digraph G, int s) {
    marked = new boolean[G.V()];
    dfs(G, s);
  }

  private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
    marked[v] = true;
    for(int w: G.adj(v)) {
      if(!marked[w]) dfs(G, w);
    }
  }

  public boolean visited(int v){
    return marked[v];
  }
}
```

#### Reachability application

##### Program control-flow analysis
+ Every program is a digraph
+ Dead-code elimination
+ Infinite-loop detection

##### Mark-sweep garbage collector
+ Every data structure is a digraph.
+ Roots. Objects known to be directly accessible by program.
+ Reachable objects. Objects indirectly accessible by program.

#### Depth-first search in digraphs summary

DFS enables direct solution of simple digraph problems.
+ Reachability
+ Path finding
+ Topological sort
+ Directed cycle detection

### Breadth-first search in digraphs
+ Every undirected graph is a digraph(with edges in both direction)
+ BFS is a digraph algorithm

BFS computes shortest paths from s to all other vertices in a digraph in tim proportional to E+V.

### Web crawler

```
Queue<String> queue = new Queue<>();

SET<String> discovered = new SET<>();

String root = "http://baidu.com";
queue.enqueue(root);
discovered.add(root);

while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
  String v = queue.dequeue();
  StdOut.println(v);
  In in = new In(v);
  String input = in.readAll();

  String regexp = "http://(\\w+\\.)*(\\w+)";
  Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regexp);
  Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);
  while(matcher.find()) {
    String w = matcher.group();
    if(!discovered.contains(w)) {
      discovered.add(w);
      queue.enqueue(w);
    }
  }
}

```

### Topological sort
Directed acyclic graph. Redraw DAG so all edges point upwards.

Reverse DFS postorder of a DAG is a topological order.

#### Depth-first search order

```
public class DepthFirstOrder{
  private boolean[] marked;
  private Stack<Integer> reversePost;

  public DepthFirstOrder(Digraph G) {
    reversePost = new Stack<Integer>();
    marked = new boolean[G.V()];
    for(int v = 0; v < G.V(); v ++) {
      if(!marked[v]) dfs(G, v);
    }
  }

  private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
    marked[v] = true;
    for(int w: G.adj(v)) {
      if(!marked[w] dfs(G, w));
    }
    reversePost.push(v);
  }

  public Iterable<Integer> reversePost() {
    return reversePost;
  }
}
```

##### Directed cycle detection
A digraph has a topological order iff no directed cycle.
+ If directed cycle, topological order is impossible.
+ If no directed cycle, DFS-based algorithms finds a topological order.

### Strongly-connected components
Vertices v and w are strongly connected if there is both a directed path from v to w and a directed path from w to v.
