# Balanced binary Search Tree

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree in symmetric order.

A binary tree is either empty or two disjoint binary trees.

## Definition
Most operations on a binary search tree(BST) take time directly proportional to the height of the tree, so it is desireble to keep the height small.

A balanced search tree is a tree that automatically keeps its height small for a sequence of insertions and deletions. This structure provide efficient implementations for abstract data structures auch as associative arrays.

The primary step to get the flexibility that we need to guarantee balance in binary search trees is to allow the nodes in our trees to hold more than one key. This can be done using 2-3 trees(not binary, but balanced).

## 2-3 tree

+ Allow 1 or 2 keys per node

	2-node: 1 key, 2 children; left is less, and right is greater than the key
	3-node: 2 keys, 3 children; left is less, middle is betweeen, and right is greater than the two keys

### Global Properties

+ Maintain symmetric order and perfect balance. Every node is larger than all the nodes on the left subtree, smaller than the keys on the right subtree, and in case of 3-node, all nodes in the middle are between the two keys of the 3-node. So, we can traverse the nodes in ascending order; In-order traversal.
+ Every path from the root to null link has same length.


### Search

+ compare search key against keys in node
+ find interval containing search key
+ follow associated link

### Insertion

+ situation 1: insert into a 2-node at bottom
+ situation 2: insert into a 3-node at bottom
+ situation 3: insert into a 3-node whose parent is a 2-node
+ situation 4: insert into a 3-node whose parent is a 3-node

### Construction

Example: S, E, A, R, C, H, X, P, L


## Read-black tree

### Left-leaning read-back BSTs

1. Represent 2-3 tree as a BST.
2. Use "internal" left-leaning links as "glue" for 3-nodes.

### An equivalent definition

A BST such that:

+ No node has two red links connected to it.
+ Every path from root to null link has the same number of black links.
+ Red links lean left.

### Red-black BST representation

```
private static final boolean RED = true;
private static final boolean BLACK = false;

private class Node{
	Key key;
	Value val;
	Node left, right;
	boolean color;
}

private boolean isRed(Node n) {
	if (n == null) return false;
	return n.color == RED;
}

```

### Search

```
public Value get(Key key) {
	Node x = root;
	while (x != null) {
		int cmp = key.compareTo(x.key);
		if (cmp < 0) x = x.left;
		else if(cmp > 0) x = x.right;
		else return x.val;
	}
}
```

### Rotations & Flipping Colors
Our implementation for red-black BSTs may allow right-leaning or two red links in a row during an operation. So we need to correct these conditions by an operation called rotation that switches orientation of red links.

1. Rotate left. Suppose that we have a right-leaning red link that need to be rotated to lean to the left.


```
private Node rotateLeft(Node h) {
	assert isRed(h.right);
	Node x = h.right;
	h.right = x.left;
	x.left = h;
	x.color = h.color;
	h.color = RED;
	return x;
}
```

2. Rotate right. Sometimes to do the insertion operation properly, we need to temporary orient the left-leaning to lean right. But, later on, we will get rid of that lean on the right.

```
private Node rorateRight(Node h) {
	assert isRed(h.left);
	Node x = h.left;
	h.left = x.right;
	x.right = h;
	x.color = h.color;
	h.color = RED;
	return x;
}

```

3. Color flip. Sometimes during the insertion operation we may end up having a node with two red links connecting to its children. This corresponding to having a temporary 4-node in a 2â€“3 tree. All what we need to do is to change the colors to split a temporary 4-node in a left-leaning red-black BST. The color flip operation flips the colors of the the two red children to black and the color of the black parent to red.

```
private void flipColors(Node h) {
	assert !isRed(h);
	assert isRed(h.left);
	assert isRed(h.right);
	h.color = RED;
	h.left.color = BLACK;
	h.right.color = BLACK;
}
```

## B tree

### Definition

Generlize 2-3 trees by allowing up to M-1 key-link pairs per node.
+ At least 2 key-link pairs at root
+ At least M/2 key-link pairs in other nodes
+ External nodes contain client keys
+ Internal nodes contain copies of keys to guide search

### Search a B-tree

+ Start at root
+ Find interval for search key and take corresponding link
+ Search terminates in external node
